# Introduction

Extend builtin syntax highlighting to referred and aliased vars in Clojure
buffers.

This is essentially a re-implementation of the dynamic highlighting feature
from Meikel Brandmeyer's VimClojure project.

# Requires:

* [fireplace.vim](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fireplace)

If you'd like this ported to another REPL plugin, please create an issue! This
can be done quite easily.

# Installation

Install as a normal Vim plugin. If you are unfamiliar with this process,
please refer to [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

# Usage

`vim-clojure-highlight` installs a hook that executes the relevant `syntax`
statements when a `*.clj` file is loaded.

This will fail silently if fireplace is unable to connect to an nREPL server.

Reload your buffer with `:e` to update syntax matches.

Reference highlighting can be toggled with the following command:

    :ToggleClojureHighlightReferences

and can be disabled by default:

    let g:clojure_highlight_references = 0
